# Decathlon Scraper
Web scraper to notify me when an item is in-stock in decathlon.

Given a URL for a item on the decathlon.ie website, the quantity of stock is determined through API calls. If the item is instock, then an email notification is sent.
The checkDecathlonStock.bat file can be run with Windows Scheduler to poll the website on a schedule.
